# CSV_Log_Generator
Generate a real time CSV log with dummy data to simulate an input data stream

Helpful in cases of simulating input data streams from IOT sensors.



========================================

I wrote this simple dummy data generator when I was playing around with getting data from OBD Scanners from a Car OBD sensor. 
Needed a dummy data generator to test the origional program without having the actual car started.

Figured it can be used in other IOT connected Android applications as well to simulate sensor data.
